This sample repository aims to help AWS customers reduce the initial setup time of a [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu) infrastructure. The technology is also used by the Central Bank of Brazil, in their [Real Digital Pilot](https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding), also known as [DREX](https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/drex).
